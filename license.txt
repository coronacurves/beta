"Software written entirely by federal government employees as part of 
their official duties can be released as “public domain” software. 
This is not under a copyright license, it is absence of a license. 
By some definitions this is technically not an open source license 
(because no license is needed), but “public domain” software can 
be legally used, modified, and combined with other software without 
restriction. Thus, “public domain” software provides recipients all 
of the rights that open source software must provide."

The CoronaCurves software in this repository was written entirely by 
federal government employees as part of their official duties.

Note, however, that certain software packages incorporated into 
CoronaCurves may carry use restrictions.  It is your responsibility
to check them.
